## Dash/Teleport Ability Idea

To get this ability, you have to find specific things to combine so that you can unlock and use this ability.

An idea I have for this is that there's a peaceful but scared animal that can already dash that you must catch and either kill or take something from it.
This animal will teleport away from you if you run too close to it.
This animal could be very weak too due to evolution because it would just teleport away from its prey. 
To get close to this animal you could either be very quiet and crouch up to them, or you could pick up something it likes to eat, and just sit and wait until it comes near and starts to trust you.
You could also grow this item as a way to sort of automate this process.

The item that you gain from this animal could then be combined with items from the surrounding area to create a power that you can infuse yourself with.

The reason for collecting the surrounding area items is because the animal had to be able to get the power from somewhere, so I believe that the things that it would eat and the auras around the animal would have infused it as a sort of passive infusion.
Although the power would not be the exact same as the power you would gain because the type of infusion would not be the same as the way you would get it.

An idea for that teleport power is that you can also infuse items or it could be used to create new spells.

## Infusion

My idea for this is that there would be a setup of pedestals in a circle that you could place items on. If you placed the correct items on the pedestals and meditate in the centre, then that ability would be given to you to use for as long as you want.

If you wanted to replace a certain spell in your body then you could either infuse yourself again and replace your current spell, sending your current spell energy into the atmosphere or place a book on a specific book stand pedestal that would absorb your current spell, allowing you to reuse or store the spell elsewhere.

You could also infuse specific items this way, as some spells may be too powerful for you to be able to contain.

Item Ideas: Rings, Belts, Robes, Boots, Gloves, Books, Scrolls

Infusion Types: Meditative Infusion, Passive Infusion, Sacrificial Infusion

### Passive Infusion

Passive Infusion is caused by specific environmental conditions that affect nearby living things.
It takes a long time to be able to infused this way and the powers you obtain arent as strong compared to other forms of infusion.

### Item/Meditative Infusion

Item Infusion is a easier way to be able to gain more powers.
It requires specific items to be placed on pedestals and for you to sit in the middle and meditate until you have absorbed the power.
You may infuse specific wearable items or books so that when you switch your outfit, you switch your abilities too.
